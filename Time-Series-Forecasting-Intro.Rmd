# ARIMA Cheat Sheet

* Examine your data
    + Plot the data and examine its patterns and irregularities.
    + Clean up any outliers or missing values if needed.
    + `tsclean()` is a convenient method for outlier removal and inputting missing values.
    + Take a logarithm of a series to help stabilize a strong growth trend.

* Decompose your data
    + Does the series appear to have trends or seasonality?
    + Use `decompose()` or `stl()` to examine and possibly remove components of the series.

* Stationarity
    + Is the series stationary?
    + Use `adf.test()`, `ACF`, `PACF` plots to determine order of differencing needed.

* Autocorrelations and choosing model order
    + Choose order of the _ARIMA_ by examining `ACF` and `PACF` plots.

* Fit an ARIMA model

* Evaluate and iterate
    + Check residuals, which should haven no patterns and be normally distributed.
    + If there are visible patterns or bias, plot `ACF/PACF`. Are any additional order parameters needed?
    + Refit model if needed. Compare model errors and fit criteria such as `AIC` or `BIC`.
    + Calculate forecast using the chosen model.
